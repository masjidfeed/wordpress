# Masjid App REST API

## Overview

The Masjid App plugin exposes a public, read-only WordPress REST API for mobile
clients. No authentication is required.

```text
{siteUrl}/wp-json/masjid/v1
```

All endpoints accept `GET` requests and return JSON. Dates and date-times use
ISO 8601 unless an endpoint explicitly states otherwise. HTML fields contain
rendered WordPress content and must be treated as HTML by clients.

## Client Identification

Every request must identify the client with a `User-Agent` header using exactly
the `appname/version` format. The name and version must each begin with a letter
or digit, contain no spaces or additional slashes, and be at most 100
characters. For example:

```http
User-Agent: MasjidApp-iOS/2.4.1
```

An absent or invalid value returns `400` with error code
`masjidapp_invalid_user_agent`. CORS preflight requests are exempt. When API
tracing is enabled, the server records the parsed application name and version
with the request trace.

For the local Docker environment:

```sh
BASE_URL='http://localhost:8000/wp-json/masjid/v1'
```

For another deployment, replace the origin:

```sh
BASE_URL='https://example.org/wp-json/masjid/v1'
```

## Errors

Errors use the standard WordPress REST error shape:

```json
{
  "code": "masjidapp_post_not_found",
  "message": "Post not found.",
  "data": {
    "status": 404
  }
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Request succeeded. |
| `304` | Cached representation is still current. See [ETag caching](#etag-caching). |
| `400` | The `User-Agent` header is missing or invalid. |
| `404` | The requested post does not exist or is not public. |
| `503` | A plugin required to provide the requested data is inactive. |

## Configuration

### `GET /config`

Returns branding, contact details, endpoint discovery URLs, and feature flags.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  --user-agent 'MasjidApp-iOS/2.4.1' \
  "$BASE_URL/config"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "masjid": {
    "id": "islamic-center-of-bothell",
    "name": "Islamic Center of Bothell",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
  },
  "branding": {
    "logoUrl": "https://example.org/wp-content/uploads/logo.png",
    "splashLogoUrl": "https://example.org/wp-content/uploads/splash.png",
    "primaryColor": "#1B7F5C",
    "primaryColorDark": "#3FBF8F"
  },
  "endpoints": {
    "salahApiUrl": "https://example.org/wp-json/masjid/v1/salahapi",
    "eventsUrl": "https://example.org/wp-json/masjid/v1/events",
    "announcementsUrl": "https://example.org/wp-json/masjid/v1/announcements"
  },
  "contact": {
    "address": "123 Example Street",
    "phone": "+1 555 0100",
    "email": "info@example.org",
    "website": "https://example.org/"
  },
  "donationUrl": "https://example.org/donate/",
  "ramadanUrl": "https://example.org/ramadan/",
  "social": {
    "facebook": "https://facebook.com/example",
    "instagram": "https://instagram.com/example",
    "whatsapp": "https://wa.me/15550100"
  },
  "featureFlags": {
    "events": true,
    "announcements": true,
    "donations": true,
    "qibla": true,
    "prayerReminders": true
  },
  "pushNotifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "configured": true,
    "registrationUrl": "https://example.org/wp-json/masjid/v1/push/registrations",
    "firebase": {
      "ios": {
        "appId": "1:123456789:ios:abcdef",
        "senderId": "123456789",
        "apiKey": "public-api-key"
      },
      "android": {
        "appId": "1:123456789:android:abcdef",
        "senderId": "123456789",
        "apiKey": "public-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All URL and contact values are strings and may be empty. `logoUrl` and
`splashLogoUrl` are empty strings when no image is configured. `ramadanUrl` is
an empty string when no Ramadan page is configured.

When Content-only Rendering is enabled under **Settings > Masjid App**, a
non-empty `donationUrl` or `ramadanUrl` automatically includes
`render=contentOnly`. Existing query parameters on either configured URL are
preserved.

`pushNotifications.configured` is true only when encrypted server credentials
and both platform configurations exist. Firebase client API keys in this
response are public application configuration; service-account credentials are
never returned.

## Push Registration

### Required App Check header

Every `POST` or `DELETE` request to `/push/registrations` **must** include a
current Firebase App Check token in this header:

```http
X-Firebase-AppCheck: <app-check-token>
```

The token must come from the MasjidApp Firebase app for the declared `platform`.
The server verifies its signature, expiration, Firebase project, and application
ID before changing any FCM topic subscription. Missing, expired, invalid, or
wrong-app tokens return `401 Unauthorized`, and no subscription change occurs.

This header is required by the API itself; it is not optional sample metadata.
Public read-only endpoints such as `/config`, `/events`, and `/announcements` do
not require App Check.

### `POST /push/registrations`

Subscribes an FCM token to this site's tenant topic. The app must initialize
Firebase with its platform configuration returned by `/config`, obtain an App
Check token from that same platform app, then register the FCM token. The `X-Firebase-AppCheck` header
described above is mandatory.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header "X-Firebase-AppCheck: $APP_CHECK_TOKEN" \
  --data '{
    "masjidId": "islamic-center-of-bothell",
    "platform": "ios",
    "token": "current-fcm-token",
    "previousToken": "previous-fcm-token"
  }' \
  "$BASE_URL/push/registrations"
```

`platform` is `ios` or `android`. `previousToken` is optional; after the new
token is subscribed successfully, it is unsubscribed to complete token
rotation. The App Check application ID must match the uploaded configuration
for the declared platform.

Example response:

```json
{
  "registered": true,
  "result": {
    "successful": true,
    "errorCount": 0
  }
}
```

### `DELETE /push/registrations`

Unsubscribes a token when the app changes tenant or disables notifications. The
`X-Firebase-AppCheck` header described above is mandatory.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  --request DELETE \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header "X-Firebase-AppCheck: $APP_CHECK_TOKEN" \
  --data '{
    "masjidId": "islamic-center-of-bothell",
    "platform": "ios",
    "token": "current-fcm-token"
  }' \
  "$BASE_URL/push/registrations"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "registered": false,
  "result": {
    "successful": true,
    "errorCount": 0
  }
}
```

Both operations return `401` for missing or invalid App Check tokens, `429`
after 30 attempts from one address within five minutes, and `503` when push is
disabled or incomplete. Raw FCM tokens are neither stored nor logged.

## Push Notification Payload

The server sends Firebase a display notification and a string-valued data
payload. For example, publishing a tagged announcement sends the following
message to the tenant topic:

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Parking update",
    "body": "The north parking lot will be closed this Friday. Please use the overflow parking area.",
    "image": "https://example.org/uploads/parking-update.jpg"
  },
  "data": {
    "notificationId": "b3976dc7-e67b-4cbe-9344-f79eb27078c2",
    "masjidId": "islamic-center-of-bothell",
    "postId": "456",
    "type": "announcements",
    "deepLink": "masjidapp://open/v1/masjids/islamic-center-of-bothell/announcements/456"
  },
  "apns": {
    "payload": {
      "aps": {
        "mutable-content": 1
      }
    },
    "fcm_options": {
      "image": "https://example.org/uploads/parking-update.jpg"
    }
  }
}
```

### Android (FCM)

An Android client receives the display notification and data through an FCM
`RemoteMessage`. The equivalent application-visible payload is:

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Parking update",
    "body": "The north parking lot will be closed this Friday. Please use the overflow parking area.",
    "image": "https://example.org/uploads/parking-update.jpg"
  },
  "data": {
    "notificationId": "b3976dc7-e67b-4cbe-9344-f79eb27078c2",
    "masjidId": "islamic-center-of-bothell",
    "postId": "456",
    "type": "announcements",
    "deepLink": "masjidapp://open/v1/masjids/islamic-center-of-bothell/announcements/456"
  }
}
```

### iOS (APNs via FCM)

FCM maps the same message to an APNs payload. Custom data fields are available
at the top level of the notification's `userInfo` dictionary:

```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "Parking update",
      "body": "The north parking lot will be closed this Friday. Please use the overflow parking area."
    },
    "mutable-content": 1
  },
  "notificationId": "b3976dc7-e67b-4cbe-9344-f79eb27078c2",
  "masjidId": "islamic-center-of-bothell",
  "postId": "456",
  "type": "announcements",
  "deepLink": "masjidapp://open/v1/masjids/islamic-center-of-bothell/announcements/456",
  "fcm_options": {
    "image": "https://example.org/uploads/parking-update.jpg"
  }
}
```

FCM and APNs may add transport metadata such as message identifiers; clients
must not depend on those fields. When no valid HTTPS featured image is present,
the Android `image`, APNs `mutable-content`, and APNs `fcm_options` fields are
omitted.

`notificationId` is stable across server retries and should be used by the app
to suppress duplicate presentation. `type` is `announcements` or `events`.
`body` uses the manual post excerpt when available, otherwise a plain-text
excerpt derived from post content, truncated to 180 characters. `deepLink`
uses the configured override template when present.

When a post has a valid HTTPS featured image, Android receives it through the
common FCM `notification.image` field. iOS receives `aps.mutable-content = 1` and
`apns.fcm_options.image`; the embedded Notification Service Extension downloads the image
and attaches it. A failed, non-HTTPS, or timed-out image request degrades to the original
title and body instead of suppressing the notification.

## Prayer Times

### `GET /salahapi`

Proxies the SalahAPI 1.1 document supplied by the Muslim Prayer Times plugin.
The returned `dailyPrayerTimes.csvUrl` points to the CSV feed from that plugin.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  "$BASE_URL/salahapi"
```

Example response (calculation rules vary by site configuration):

```json
{
  "salahapi": "1.1",
  "info": {
    "title": "Islamic Center of Bothell Prayer Times",
    "description": "Islamic prayer times provided by Islamic Center of Bothell",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "contact": {
      "name": "Islamic Center of Bothell",
      "email": "info@example.org"
    }
  },
  "location": {
    "latitude": 47.7623,
    "longitude": -122.2054,
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "dateFormat": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "timeFormat": "h:mm A"
  },
  "calculationMethod": {
    "name": "isna",
    "asrCalculationMethod": "standard",
    "highLatitudeAdjustment": "middleOfTheNight",
    "iqamaCalculationRules": {
      "changeOn": "friday",
      "fajr": {
        "change": "weekly",
        "afterAthanMinutes": 20
      },
      "dhuhr": {
        "static": "13:30"
      },
      "asr": {
        "change": "weekly",
        "afterAthanMinutes": 15
      },
      "maghrib": {
        "change": "weekly",
        "afterAthanMinutes": 5
      },
      "isha": {
        "change": "weekly",
        "afterAthanMinutes": 15
      }
    },
    "jumuahRules": [
      {
        "name": "First Jumuah",
        "time": {
          "static": "13:30"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "dailyPrayerTimes": {
    "csvUrl": "https://example.org/wp-json/muslim-prayer-times/v1/prayer-times-csv?asrMethod=standard",
    "csvUrlParameters": {
      "fromDate": {
        "in": "query",
        "type": "fromDate",
        "format": "YYYY-MM-DD"
      },
      "toDate": {
        "in": "query",
        "type": "toDate",
        "format": "YYYY-MM-DD"
      }
    },
    "dateFormat": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "timeFormat": "h:mm A"
  }
}
```

`info.contact` is omitted when the site has no valid admin email.
`calculationMethod.iqamaCalculationRules` always contains `fajr`, `dhuhr`,
`asr`, `maghrib`, and `isha`. A prayer rule is either a fixed-time object with
`static` and optional daylight-saving `overrides`, or a calculated object with
`change` (`daily` or `weekly`) and optional `roundMinutes`, `earliest`,
`latest`, `afterAthanMinutes`, `beforeEndMinutes`, and Ramadan `overrides`.
`changeOn` is present for weekly configuration. `jumuahRules` is present only
when at least one Jumuah time is configured; each item has `name` and
`time.static`.

If the Muslim Prayer Times plugin is unavailable, this endpoint returns `503`
with error code `masjidapp_missing_dependency`.

## Post Object

The `/events` and `/announcements` endpoints return arrays of the post
object returned by `/posts/{id}`. Every post contains these base fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `postId` | integer | WordPress post ID used by app deep links. |
| `title` | string | Rendered WordPress post title. |
| `description` | string | Full rendered HTML post content. |
| `postUrl` | string | Absolute URL for `GET /posts/{id}`. |
| `publishedAt` | string | ISO 8601 publication time in UTC. |
| `image` | string or `null` | Absolute large featured-image URL. |
| `category` | string | First non-`uncategorized` category slug, or an empty string. |
| `url` | string | Absolute WordPress permalink. |

Posts with event dates enabled also contain these event fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `isEvent` | boolean | Always `true`; omitted from posts without event metadata. |
| `location` | string | Empty when no location is configured. |
| `eventDateTime` | string or `null` | Next occurrence in the WordPress site timezone. |
| `recurrenceRule` | string or `null` | iCalendar recurrence rule when available. |
| `alert` | string | Optional; omitted when no alert is configured. |
| `alertEndDateTime` | string | Optional; omitted when no valid expiration is configured. |

## Events

### `GET /events`

Returns an array containing at most 20 published upcoming events, ordered by
event date ascending. Site settings may filter the result by category or tag.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  "$BASE_URL/events"
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "postId": 123,
    "title": "Community Dinner",
    "description": "<p>Join us for dinner after Maghrib.</p>\n",
    "postUrl": "https://example.org/wp-json/masjid/v1/posts/123",
    "publishedAt": "2026-07-15T18:00:00+00:00",
    "image": "https://example.org/wp-content/uploads/community-dinner.jpg",
    "isEvent": true,
    "location": "Main prayer hall",
    "category": "community",
    "eventDateTime": "2026-08-07T19:30:00-07:00",
    "recurrenceRule": null,
    "url": "https://example.org/community-dinner/",
    "alert": "Registration required",
    "alertEndDateTime": "2026-08-07T18:00:00-07:00"
  }
]
```

If no events plugin is selected in MasjidFeed App settings, or the selected
plugin is inactive, this endpoint returns `503` with error code
`masjidapp_missing_dependency`. Supported event plugins are Awesome Calendar
Events and The Events Calendar.

## Announcements

### `GET /announcements`

Returns an array containing at most 20 published, non-password-protected posts,
ordered by publication date descending. Site settings may filter the result by
category or tag. Administrators may also select a Friday category that replaces
the regular announcement filters on Fridays in the WordPress site timezone.

```sh
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  "$BASE_URL/announcements"
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "postId": 456,
    "title": "Parking update",
    "description": "<p>The north parking lot is closed this Friday.</p>\n",
    "postUrl": "https://example.org/wp-json/masjid/v1/posts/456",
    "publishedAt": "2026-08-03T17:15:00+00:00",
    "image": null,
    "category": "announcements",
    "url": "https://example.org/parking-update/"
  }
]
```

## Post

### `GET /posts/{id}`

Returns one post object, including event fields when event dates are enabled.
`{id}` must be a positive integer identifying a published,
non-password-protected `post`.

```sh
POST_ID=123
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  "$BASE_URL/posts/$POST_ID"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "postId": 123,
  "title": "Community Dinner",
  "description": "<p>Join us for dinner after Maghrib.</p>\n",
  "postUrl": "https://example.org/wp-json/masjid/v1/posts/123",
  "publishedAt": "2026-07-15T18:00:00+00:00",
  "image": "https://example.org/wp-content/uploads/community-dinner.jpg",
  "category": "community",
  "url": "https://example.org/community-dinner/",
  "isEvent": true,
  "location": "Main prayer hall",
  "eventDateTime": "2026-08-07T19:30:00-07:00",
  "recurrenceRule": null,
  "alert": "Registration required",
  "alertEndDateTime": "2026-08-07T18:00:00-07:00"
}
```

The endpoint returns `404` with error code `masjidapp_post_not_found` when the
post is missing, is not a standard WordPress post, is not published, or is
password protected.

## ETag Caching

The following responses support conditional requests:

| Endpoint | ETag | `Cache-Control` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /config` | Weak, generated from the JSON payload | `public, max-age=60, s-maxage=3600` |
| `GET /salahapi` | Strong, prayer-times update timestamp | `public, max-age=60, s-maxage=3600` |
| `GET /events` | Weak, generated from the JSON payload | `public, max-age=60, s-maxage=300` |
| `GET /announcements` | Weak, generated from the JSON payload and active filter mode | `public, max-age=60, s-maxage=600` |
| `GET /posts/{id}` | Weak, generated from the JSON payload | `public, max-age=60, s-maxage=3600` |

Configuration, event, and post responses use a weak ETag generated from
the exact JSON payload. Announcement ETags also include whether the regular or
Friday filter is active, ensuring they change at Friday's boundaries:

```http
ETag: W/"2eb7f86a..."
```

SalahAPI uses the prayer-times last-updated value as a strong ETag. It omits the
header until prayer times have been updated at least once.

The server stores each configuration, event, announcement, and post
payload with its ETag in a WordPress transient for up to 24 hours. Relevant
content or settings changes invalidate these transients earlier. This
server-side lifetime is independent of the browser and shared-cache lifetimes
in the `Cache-Control` table above. Announcement cache lifetimes are shortened
when necessary so they do not cross into or out of Friday. SalahAPI derives its
ETag from the prayer-times update timestamp rather than this transient cache.

Store the complete header value, including the quotes and the `W/` prefix when
present, then send it in `If-None-Match` when revalidating. A matching
representation returns `304 Not Modified` with no response body. An omitted or
nonmatching validator returns `200` with the current JSON body and ETag.

Fetch a response and inspect its cache headers:

```sh
curl --silent --show-error --dump-header - \
  "$BASE_URL/events"
```

Capture the ETag and revalidate:

```sh
ETAG=$(
  curl --silent --show-error --dump-header - --output /dev/null \
    "$BASE_URL/events" \
  | awk 'tolower($1) == "etag:" { sub(/^[^:]+:[[:space:]]*/, ""); sub(/\r$/, ""); print; exit }'
)

curl --silent --show-error --dump-header - --output /dev/null \
  --header "If-None-Match: $ETAG" \
  "$BASE_URL/events"
```

Expected status line when the content has not changed:

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

The server also accepts a strong form of the current ETag, comma-separated
candidate ETags, or `If-None-Match: *`. Browsers may read `ETag` and send
`If-None-Match` in cross-origin requests because both headers are included in
the route's CORS policy.

Saving Masjid App settings invalidates the cached configuration. The next
`GET /config` rebuilds the response and derives a new ETag when its JSON payload
has changed.
